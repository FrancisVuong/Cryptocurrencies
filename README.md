# Cryptocurrencies

Use unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to analyze data on the cryptocurrencies traded on the market.

## Project Background

Present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing a new investment product. Use unsupervised ML clustering algorithm to help determine cryptocurrencies groups.

## Project Objectives

- Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.

- Reduce data dimensions using PCA (Principal Component Anylysis) algorithms from sklearn.

- Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.

- Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

## Data Resources

- The cryptocurrencies data was retrieved from <https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist>

- The csv format data resource (/Resources/crypto_data.csv)

## Codes

- [Jupyter_Notebook](/crypto_PCA_kmeans.ipynb) 

- [Python](/crypto_PCA_kmeans.py)

## Summary

We have identified the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features.
Particularities of each group need to be analyzed to determined their performance and potential interest for the investment bank's clients.
